To add a **set data structure** to this C program, you can introduce it to manage a collection of unique elements. In this case, we could use a set to track unique product IDs, or manage unique product categories, or any other scenario where we want to ensure that no duplicates are allowed.

Since C doesn’t have built-in support for sets, we’ll implement a simple set using an array, ensuring no duplicate entries. Let's add a **Product Category Set** to keep track of unique categories for products.

### Steps:
1. **Define the Set Structure**: We will use an array to store the set elements (product categories) and track the size of the set.
2. **Set Functions**: Implement functions to add elements to the set, check for membership, and display the set.

Here’s how you can incorporate this into the single C file:

### Updated C File with Sets: `product_management_system.c`

```

### Key Changes:
1. **Set Structure (`CategorySet`)**:
   - A set is used to track unique product categories.
   - The set is implemented using a simple array `categories`, and the `size` field tracks the number of elements in the set.

2. **Set Functions**:
   - `add_to_set`: Adds a category to the set if it doesn’t already exist.
   - `is_in_set`: Checks whether a category is already in the set.
   - `display_set`: Displays all categories in the set.

3. **Product Category**:
   - Each product now has a `category` field, and when a product is added, its category is also added to the `CategorySet` if it’s unique.

4. **Menu Options**:
   - The menu now has an option to display all the unique product categories stored in the set.

### Running the Program:
Compile and run it as before:
```bash
gcc product_management_system.c -o product_management_system
./product_management_system
```

### Example Output:

```

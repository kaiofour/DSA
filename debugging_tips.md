Got it! Here's the revised explanation without any bold formatting:

1. Use compiler warnings: Always compile your code with warnings enabled (e.g., `gcc -Wall -Wextra yourfile.c`). Compiler warnings can help you spot potential issues in your code.

2. Print statements: Use `printf()` to output variable values and the flow of execution. This helps trace where things may be going wrong.

3. Debugging tools: 
   - GDB (GNU Debugger) is a powerful tool to step through your code, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.
   - Valgrind is useful for detecting memory leaks and improper memory usage.

4. Code review: Take the time to review your code, or have someone else review it. A fresh perspective can help spot mistakes you might have overlooked.

5. Divide and conquer: Break your code into smaller sections and test each part independently to isolate issues.

6. Use assertions: Use the `assert()` function to verify assumptions in your code. If an assertion fails, it can indicate where things went wrong.

7. Check boundary conditions: Pay special attention to boundary conditions when dealing with arrays, loops, and pointers, as off-by-one errors are common.

8. Leverage IDE features: Many IDEs like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or Eclipse offer built-in debugging tools such as breakpoints, variable watching, and stepping through code.

9. Read error messages carefully: When a program crashes, error messages and core dumps often give helpful clues about what went wrong.

10. Unit testing: Writing unit tests for your functions helps ensure that individual components of your code behave as expected.

11. Documentation and comments: Keep your code well-commented, especially around complex logic, so that it's easier to understand and debug later.

12. Stay organized: Maintain a clean code structure with consistent naming conventions and modular design to make it easier to find and fix bugs. 

This approach will help you identify and resolve issues quickly in your C programs.

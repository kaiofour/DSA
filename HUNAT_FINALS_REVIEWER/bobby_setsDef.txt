SETS are a collection of unique elements:
    
Characteristics of SETS:
    - Order doesn't matter.
    - Sets are a subsets of its universal set in which the
    number of elems in a subset is less than or equal to the
    number of elems in the universal set.


Implementations: Array, LL, Bit-Vector, Comp-Word


OPERATIONS: UID (Union, Intersection, Difference)

BIT VECTOR = ONE-DIMENSIONAL array of BINARY DIGITS

sizeof(universalSet) == sizeof(subsets)
     -this is regardless of the subset's
    number of elements.



PROS OF BIT VECTOR:
    - 0(1)
    - Array implementation of sets
    - Best implementation of an ADT set
    - Size if a subset is proportional to its universal set



 Pre-requisites of Bit-Vector:
    1. Decimal to Binary Conversion
    2. 2's complement AND/OR shortcut
    3. BITWISE operators (&, |, ^, ~)
    4. SHIFT operations (left shift: <<, right shift: >>)
        -logical (0 padding as unsigned)
        arithmetic (designated signed bit)
 


  Explanation of 2's Complement
    -representation of negative numbers in binary
  
  example:
  28 = 0001 1100
  ~28 = 1110 0011
  +1 =         1
  _______________
  -28 = 1110 0100 (negative 28)
 
 

**SET BASICS**

A set is a collection of items.

Example set: {4, 9, 2}


We can have an empty set with no elements.

Empty set: {}


The order of the elements in the set doesn't matter.

So {4, 9, 2} is equal to {9, 2, 4}.


The number of occurrences of an element in the set
doesn't matter.

So {4, 4, 4, 9, 2} is equal to {4, 9, 2}

So we will only need to store unique elements of a set.

We can insert elements into a set:

insert 4 int {2, 9} gives us the set {4, 2, 9}


Set Union:
    {1, 2, 3} union {2, 3, 4} = {1, 2, 3, 4}

    the union of sets includes all elements from BOTH sets.


Set Intersection:
    {1, 2, 3} intersection {2, 3, 4} = {2, 3}

    the intersection of sets contains all the elements of
    one set that are also in the other set.


Set Difference:
    {1, 2, 3} - {2, 3, 4} = {1}

    the difference of the sets contains all the elements
    of the first set that are not also in the second set.


Subset:
    {1, 2} is a subset of {1, 2, 3}

    a set A is a subset of set B if all the elements of A
    are also elements of B.


Membership:
    2 is a member of the set {1, 2, 3}

    4 is NOT a member of the set {1, 2, 3}
